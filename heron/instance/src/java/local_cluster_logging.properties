# Properties file which configures the operation of the JDK 
# logging facility.

# The system will look for this config file, first using 
# a System property specified at startup: 
# 
# >java -Djava.util.logging.config.file=myLoggingConfigFilePath 
# 
# If this property is not specified, then the config file is 
# retrieved from its default location at: 
# 
# JDK_HOME/jre/lib/logging.properties

# Global logging properties. 
# ------------------------------------------ 
# The set of handlers to be loaded upon startup. 
# Comma-separated list of class names. 
# (? LogManager docs say no comma here, but JDK example has comma.) 

# Please do not add any FileHanlder here, 
# since we will add FileHandler programmatically

# Default global logging level. 
# Loggers and Handlers may override this level 
# Please remember we need to set the level to be ALL here
# since other loggers will use this level by default
# and we do not set the level in logger specificly.
# And we set SERVE here, other loggers may not print INFO or DEBUG correctly.
.level=ALL

# --- FileHandler --- 
# Override of global logging level 
# Please do not add any FileHandler config in this file
# We will add FileHandler programmatically during runtime
# to match the log file's name matches the process
